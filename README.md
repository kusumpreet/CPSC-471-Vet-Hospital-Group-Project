Abstract: 
Our project centres around creating a website and an app that caters to a Vet
Hospital. It not only caters to the clients of the vet hospital, but it is also meant to
be used by the employees working at the vet hospital and the admin. There are
different levels of hierarchies when it comes to the things accessible to each
user. The clients are the ones with client profile which consist of client details
which can be edited by the client, pet details, appointment details and shopping
history. Questions can be asked by the clients which can be answered by any of
the employees. The clients get excess to blog which is posted by the
administration and written by the employees and professionals.
